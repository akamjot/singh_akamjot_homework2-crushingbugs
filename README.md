Homework 2 

I have created a drag and drop game using the file provided by our professor in which there were two following errors :-

1. We were able to drag more than one pieces into the drop zone which was not supposed to happen.

2. We need to create a function for the reset button to move the pieces from the dropzone to there original place.

NOW FOR SOLUTIONS :-

For first bug i used 'if' function in which i determined the element count which is "==0" to make sure that no more than one piece will be there in the dropzone.

For second bug i used resetBoard function in which i used removeChild from the parent Node by using getElementById syntax and for this i also made some changes in html. Honestly i learned this from youtube because javascript is so difficult i almost forget everything taught in the class but fortunatly with the help of youtube i was able to do it.
